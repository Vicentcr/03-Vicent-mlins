        <h2>The Lore</h2>
        <p id="topplore"><strong>Dark Souls 3</strong> begins in the final moments of the last cycle of the Flame, with corruption and madness ravaging
            the various realms of the world. The young prince Lothric was the man destined to bind the Flame, but he
            refused his duty. As the Fire Link was endangered, the Link Shrine bell rang so that the Lords of Cinder,
            who once immolated themselves in the Original Flame, would rise up and do what was right again. But this
            time, the Lords have also refused to fulfill their mission and have abandoned their thrones.
        </p>
        <p id="midplore">It is then that the <q>Latents</q> rise up, ancient cursed undead who tried to bind the flame but failed.
            That is us, The Chosen from the Ashes, The Unkindled One.</p>

        <p id="lastplore">The Lords who have abandoned their duty are Aldrich, the Saint of Darkness; Yhorm, the Giant; the Watchers of
            the Abyss and Prince Lothric himself. Only one remains on his throne, the aged Ludleth of Courland. All the
            others have returned to their native homes for various reasons, and it is our mission to go and bring them
            back, whether voluntarily or not...</p>
